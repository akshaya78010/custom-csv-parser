# Custom CSV Reader and Writer

## Overview
This project implements a custom CSV reader and writer from scratch in Python without using the built-in csv module. The goal is to understand low-level CSV parsing, handling edge cases such as quoted fields, escaped quotes, and embedded newlines.

## Setup
```bash
python generate_data.py
python benchmark.py
